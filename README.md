## Some notes along the way...

### Day 1

Solving the puzzles was easy, but using GitHub is still clumsy and non-intuitive. Keep practicing.

### Day 2

My solution is broken into lots of little functions; this makes it easy for me to keep track of what I'm doing while I'm
writing, but I'm not sure whether it helps the reader. It will be interesting to see how my style changes over the
month, as puzzles get more difficult.

### Day 3

This looks like a great chance to practice using list comprehensions. As I get more familiar with writing these clever
and compact code structures, I hope they'll be easier to read.
