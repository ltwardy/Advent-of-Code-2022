## Some notes along the way...

### Day 1

Solving the puzzles was easy, but using GitHub is still clumsy and non-intuitive. Keep practicing.

### Day 2

My solution is broken into lots of little functions; this makes it easy for me to keep track of what I'm doing while I'm
writing, but I'm not sure whether it helps the reader. It will be interesting to see how my style changes over the
month, as puzzles get more difficult.

### Day 3

This looks like a great chance to practice using list comprehensions. As I get more familiar with writing these clever
and compact code structures, I hope they'll be easier to read.

### Day 4

This puzzle felt surprisingly easy; I hope that I'm as pleased when I look back at this code later as I am today. My
solution would probably be too memory-intensive for large data sets (looking at you, day 22 of 2021) but for the actual
puzzle data today it was just fine.

I'm working on a wrapper script, just for fun, to make it easy to run multiple AoC solutions in an interactive session.
This wouldn't be so hard if I hardcoded the paths to all the relevant files, but wouldn't it be great to use relative
paths instead? That turns out not to be a trivial problem. I need to learn about pathlib until it makes sense.

### Day 5

I feel so rusty. Lots of my solving time today was actually looking up things like 'rstrip' and shortcutting with
boolean operators. Once I got the input file parsed, the rest of the puzzle wasn't bad.
